## Overview

This repository contains code and data for detecting irrigation in the Ethiopian Highlands. Through a process detailed in the above linked paper, training data representing a binary distinction -- irrigation vs. no irrigation -- is collected and cleaned. That data is then used to train and test a series of machine-learning based classification models. Further scripts are included that process irrigation predictions and generate insights based on model performance.
